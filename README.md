# DoF Explorer

Depth of field is one of the most important concepts in photography
and it's good to have some intuition about what settings will give you the desired effect.
You can determine the near and far limits using equations,
but they are rather complicated and depend on a lot of variables.
That's where DoF Explorer will help.

This app is more than just another depth of field calculator.
Rather than just spitting out the values for given data, it lets you trace
how your DoF changes when parameters like aperture, focal length or distance from the subject
go up or down, visualizing it on an interactive and customizable graph.
